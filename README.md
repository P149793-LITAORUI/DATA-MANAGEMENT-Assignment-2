# Airline On-Time Performance Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction
- Background and significance of the project  
- Data source and analysis objectives  
- Specific year of data selected (as assigned in the appendix)

---

## 2. Data Overview
- Dataset description (field names, volume, time span, etc.)  
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, data type conversions, outlier treatment)  
- Overview of tools and methods used (e.g., Python, pandas, visualization tools)

---

## 3. Delay Pattern Analysis

### 1. Time of Day Analysis
- Average delays by time of day (morning/afternoon/evening/night)  
- Visualization (e.g., box plots, bar charts)

### 2. Day of the Week Analysis
- On-time performance by day of the week  
- Identify days with the best/worst performance

### 3. Monthly/Seasonal Analysis
- Average delay or on-time rates by month or season  
- Analysis of the impact of holidays, weather, etc.

---

## 4. Delay Factors Analysis

### 1. Identification of Main Delay Reasons
- Analyze delay categories (e.g., weather, carrier, NAS, security, late aircraft) by frequency and total minutes  

### 2. Quantifying the Impact
- Average delay time per category  
- Percentage contribution to total delays  
- Visualization (e.g., stacked bar charts, pie charts)

---

## 5. Cancellation Analysis

### 1. Reasons for Cancellations
- Categorized analysis of cancellation reasons (e.g., weather, carrier, NAS, security)  
- Share of each cancellation type

### 2. Patterns of Cancellations
- Cancellation rate by airline, airport, or time period  
- Identify whether cancellations cluster around certain patterns

---

## 6. Problematic Routes Analysis

### 1. Identifying High-Risk Routes
- Analyze origin-destination pairs with high delays or cancellations  
- Identify the most problematic routes  

### 2. In-Depth Route Issue Analysis
- Correlate route problems with delay/cancellation types  
- Explore possible causes (e.g., airline, time of day, weather conditions)

---

## 7. Conclusion & Recommendations
- Summary of key findings  
- Actionable recommendations for airlines and passengers  
- Limitations of the data and suggestions for future research

---

## 8. Appendix
- Detailed field descriptions  
- Code snippets or formulas (optional)  
- References and data source links
